## RobWorkStudio Plugin

The SamplePlugin is a RobWorkStudio Plugin, meaning that this is not an executable, but a plugin that must be loaded by RobWorkStudio.

### Manually Load Plugin

To load a plugin manually select Plugins->"load plugin" in RobWorkStudio and then select the generated plugin. For the provided SamplePlugin the file name is libRoViPlugin.so, here ".so" means that it is a library file and therefore not directly executable.

### Automatically Load Plugin

RobWorkStudio can automatically load your plugin when it starts, by providing it with an .RobWorkStudio.ini file in your home directory meaning "~/.RobWorkStudio.ini" or "/home/rovi2022/.RobWorkStudio.ini".

The file should contain the following to load:

[Plugins]

RoViPlugin\DockArea=1
RoViPlugin\Filename=libRoViPlugin.so
RoViPlugin\Path=/path/to/the/pluginFolder
RoViPlugin\Visible=true
You can replace "RoViPlugin" with whatever you name your plugin.

DockArea: is where the the Plugin should be placed in RobWorkStudio when it opens initially
Filename: is the name of the Plugin file. OBS. no path only name
Path: is where the plugin is placed
Visible: this is whether the plugin should be visible when RobWorkStudio is started or if you should click on the plugin icon to open it.
